# German Traffic Sign Classification Using TensorFlow


In this project, I used Python and TensorFlow to classify traffic signs.

Dataset used: German Traffic Sign Dataset. This dataset has more than 50,000 images of 43 classes.

I was able to reach a +96% validation accuracy, and a 90.6% testing accuracy.


## Pipeline architecture:
-> Load The Data

-> Dataset Summary & Exploration

-> Data Preprocessing

-> Design a Model

-> Model Training and Evaluation.

-> Testing the Model Using the Test Set.

-> Testing the Model on New Images.
